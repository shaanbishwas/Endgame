# Tasks

*   **Task 1: Git, HTML Tags**
  
  You are required to **clone** this repository and fix some minor stuff and send me pull-requests (Commit messages should be sensible)!  
  
  1.    There are some intended typos (spelling-mistakes), if you find them, correct them and send a pull-request. (IGNORE the lorem ipsum text!)
  2.    If you go through the HTML file, there are some unclosed tags (although it still works). Again, find them, close them, send them.

  You might want to go through the HTML file while keeping the final web-page opened along side to get a rough idea of how it all works.

*   **Task 2: HTML & CSS**
  
  Your task is to create a web page that matches the example given here. Your page must match mine exactly in terms of semantics, aesthetics and format. You have the creative freedom to choose your fonts, colors and obviously the contents.
  <br />
  Basically what you have to create is a wiki page about yourself. I hope this will let you build confidence when it comes to your knowledge on HTML and a little bit of CSS. And you will have to go through some time of self-reflection to write stuff about yourself.

  **Here is what you have to make**

  What will be the judging criteria?
  1.    HTML5 syntax, with semantic tags. HEAD, BODY, HEADER, NAV, 3 SECTIONS(Intro, Idols, Achievements), FOOTER(In case you want to get into designing-add YOUR logo) 
  2.    How close your final web page looks to mine?
  3.    You are obviously encouraged to add more stuff given that you have all the required stuff there.
